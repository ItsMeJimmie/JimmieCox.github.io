# PortfolioWebsite
Portfolio Website 

This is my README file that will cover my portfolio webpage. This webpage consits of my navigation section, hero section, projects section, skills section, and contact section.

NAVIGATION

This navigation section consists of two parts, the left and right side. The left side holds my name (Jimmie Cox) and the right side holds four buttons. 
	Button1 (GITHUB): This is a link to my github page to see my profile
	Button2 (LinkedIn): This is my link to my LinkedIn profile page
	Button3 (Email): This will open your default email application and prepare to send an email to me.
	Button 4: (About Me): This will redirect you to a new page that primarily serves the function of just an About Me page. Talking about myself and my interests and such

HERO SECTION

This herosection has three parts. The first part is the hero section text which introduces myself and who I am.

The second part is the image that holds a picture of myself.

The third part is a small text section below my hero section text that talks about how you can press the About Me button to see more information
about me.

PROJECTS SECTION

This section focuses on the different projects I've worked on. It includes 5 buttons that you can look at. They will redirect you to their respective github repositories.

SKILLS

This section is a lot like the projects except without the icons being clickable buttons. They simply list out what skills I've developed.

CONTACT

This section is a lot like the email button except it is expanded and you can set up the email on the website.

CONCLUSION

At it's current state, there will be more expanded to this website but as for now, this is what I've got.
